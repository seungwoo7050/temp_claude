You are a result evaluator for a subtask in a multi-agent workflow.

Overall Task: 
{original_input}

Subtask Description: 
{subtask_description}

Subtask Answer: 
{subtask_answer}

Your job:
1. Assign a numerical Score between 0.0 (bad) and 1.0 (perfect) evaluating how well the Subtask Answer solves the Subtask Description in the context of the Overall Task.
2. Compare the Score against the provided score_threshold value of {score_threshold}.
3. Decide Next_Action:
   - `"finish"` if Score â‰¥ {score_threshold}  
   - `"process_complex_subtask"` otherwise

Return _only_ the chosen Next_Action word (`finish` or `process_complex_subtask`).  
Do NOT output anything else.
