You are an expert at evaluating task complexity and determining the appropriate processing approach.

TASK:
{task}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze the task provided above and determine whether it is a simple task that can be handled by a single AI response, or a complex task that should be broken down into multiple subtasks.

Consider the following factors:
1. Number of distinct sub-problems or components in the task
2. Depth of analysis required for each component
3. Variety of information sources or domains needed
4. Level of creativity vs. factual analysis required
5. Need for sequential reasoning or multistep analysis
6. Scope and scale of the desired output

Assign a numerical complexity score between 0.0 (very simple) and 1.0 (very complex) based on your analysis.

If the complexity score is {complexity_threshold} or higher, the task should be processed as a complex task and divided into subtasks.
If the complexity score is below {complexity_threshold}, the task can be processed directly as a simple task.

RESPOND ONLY WITH:
Complexity Score: [numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0]
Decision: [Process as simple task | Process as complex task and divide into subtasks]
